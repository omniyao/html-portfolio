    <h2> Summary </h2>
    <p1> Hello I am Omni Yao 22 years old and this is my very first html project, my goal is to be a full stack engineer and to be able to achieve my dreams to be a digital nomad.
        My motto in life is YOLO, you only live once that is why I want to make sure that everything I do everyday would be something to move forward in life. I might have alot of
    stupid things happening in life right now but I am pretty sure that everything will pass and everything is happening for a reason. </p1>
